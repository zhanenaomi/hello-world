My first repository - tutorial

Hi! My name is Zhan√© and I am a university student studying sports science. 
I got into programming last year as I learnt to use MATLAB for my research while on placement as a biomechanist.
Currently I am learning R and Python, and attempting to strengthen my skills in MATLAB!
